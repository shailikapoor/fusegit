So what is different in 'FuseGit'?\r\nGit is a version control system which has some features of a file system. But\r\nfor a normal user it still looks like a version control system, and has a\r\nlearning curve. `FuseGit` is primarily a file system. So, if you have the\r\nrequired dependencies and you install it, you don't need to know about the inner\r\nworkings and can use it like any other file system.\r\n\r\nHow it started\r\n--------------\r\nThe project was just an idea when I first learnt about `Git`. The project became\r\na reality after one year, as part of a course project in the course **Operating\r\nSystems**.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\nFuse: v2.9.2\r\nlibgit2: v0.17.0\r\n\r\nYou need to install them, and have them in the path before installing fusegit.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nmake\r\n\r\nYou can run the following command to get instructions:\r\n./fusegit\r\n\r\nPlease see the [wiki](http://github.com/varun729/fusegit/wiki) to track the progress.\r\n\r\nIncremental Goals\r\n-----------------\r\n1. Reliable when FUSE runs in single thread\r\n2. Fast\r\n3. Run a `fsck` type of utility which identifies the useless commits and removes\r\nthem from the commit history.\r\n4. Run `git pack` on the repository, and every thing should still run fine.\r\n5. Reliable when FUSE runs in multi thread\r\n\r\n### Information\r\nFound another project with similar goals:\r\n[git-fs](http://github.com/patrickhaller/git-fs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","tagline":"a FUSE filesystem based on Git object database as its backend."}
