Git is known to be a file system in \r\nitself. So what is different in 'FuseGit'.\r\n\r\nFuseGit is a file system first, and has the features of Git at its backend. So \r\nif you modified a file and want to revert back. There is a backup waiting for \r\nyou. If you keep taking snapshots of your file system, then it becomes \r\nextremely easy for FuseGit to revert you back in time. But, if you didn't name \r\nit, it will still keep taking snapshots regularly. And you can choose your time \r\nfrom the list provided to you.\r\n\r\nAll this sounds non-magical if you are familiar with Git or any other version \r\ncontrol system. But for people who don't want the added complexity of playing \r\nwith a VCS, FuseGit will give a ready to use recipe. Just plug it in. And have \r\nregular backups of your file system, without worrying about too much memory \r\nbeing consumed.\r\n\r\nCleaning up\r\n-----------\r\nHave you ever looked at the Linux repository? If you do a clone of the \r\nrepository, it will be several multiples of the actual filesize. This is \r\nbecause they are storing every possible content. This is a common issue with \r\nany VCS, it grows in size with time more than the actual content. This can be \r\nhandled if you take care to clean up the history markers at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n--------------\r\n`FUSE` is in the name, so we are obviously using it. This means that the file \r\nsystem is in user space. This is a prototype version and we want to keep things \r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n`libgit2` will be used to get the Git functionality. This library is still \r\nunder active development. I hope we don't end up requiring a feature which is \r\nstill under development. This is a risk we might have to take right now.\r\n\r\n### libgit2\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### FUSE\r\nTODO\r\n","google":""}
